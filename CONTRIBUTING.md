# Contributing to Pythonista

Hey! First of all, thank you for trying to make Pythonista projects better!  
To get started with contributing here, let's go through the steps and requirements.

## Reporting an issue

1. Navigate to the project's issue tracker by clicking on the `Issues` tab in the Github UI
2. Ensure your bug was not already reported by searching through already existing issues
3. If you're unable to find an existing issue with your problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a clear title, description, and as much other information as possible. Preferrably, include a minimal code sample that reproduces the issue.

## Contributing Code

1. When contributing a substantial new feature please open an issue with your idea in the project's issue tracker first.
2. All contributions to our projects (new features, bug fixes, or other changes) must be suggested through a Pull Request.
    1. To do so you'll have to fork the repository, create a new branch and push your changes to it using git.
    2. Keep your commit messages concise and clean. To add more context use the "long commit" functionality.[^commit]
    3. Create a new Pull Request through the GitHub UI by going to the forked repository on your personal account.
3. Incoming PRs will be peer reviewed by at least one project maintainer. Your code will be merged once approved.[^review]
4. On projects with Continuous Integration (CI), your changes must pass certain checks in order to be merged. This step has assumed expected knowledge so please do not be afraid to ask for help[^chat] on getting things to work smoothly.
5. On projects with a larger known userbase, the above steps may take longer to progress as there will be testing we require to be carried out. Please do not assume we are being inattentive to your work, we are likely testing things behind the scenes before reporting back.

[^commit]: Give commits a more detailed description by adding two newlines after your commit message, and then writing one or more paragraphs of text.

[^review]: Project owners may merge PRs containing urgent or serious bug fixes without peer review, so long as the code has been fully tested beforehand.
